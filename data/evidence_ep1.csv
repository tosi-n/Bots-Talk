		The Dynamics of Healthy Relationships
	
 



 



Healthy Relationship Dynamics

 
Since the dawn of time people have been trying to get along. Such a simple task has proven over the centuries to be a daunting one. In certain situations, ""getting along"" has been completely impossible.
For some reason, despite the fact that we are all human with the same five senses and bodily functions, we are all completely different -- so different that we have been told over the years that no two people even have the same fingerprint. That's pretty amazing when you realize that at last count, there were around 6.4 billion people in the world.
Whether it is a relationship with our family, our spouse, our children, or employees, it seems that getting along and maintaining healthy relationships has become the Eighth Wonder of the World. To compound matters, as humans we can also have relationships with things such as our bank account, our jobs, and our possessions.

We have relationships, and the potential for relationships, all around us -- some of which you may not have realized you had. They are all there and either taking positive time and space, or negative time and space in your life -- which depends on how you choose to distribute your power.
You may have noticed the word ""choose"" is used regarding how we handle our relationships. This article is based on the concept that all relationships we are involved in, and our response to them, are a matter of choice. We are not victims -- unless we choose to be. Life, and our reaction to it, depends on many things, but the bottom line is we choose how to interpret and handle our relationships.
You will examine your belief systems and those of the people around you, and learn how they are affecting your life. In addition, we will look at a wide variety of skills that can be developed to empower you and make your relationships a meaningful and positive part of your life. At times you will be asked to consider new and different ideas that will force you to think outside of your comfort zone. Are you ready to do that? Are you willing?

There is a saying: ""To get to the fruit of the tree you have to go out on the green leafy branches."" Many people fear this and are comfortable in their enclosed world. It may not be working for them but their unhappiness is a known comfort. They would rather stay in their unhappiness than think outside the box. They like to talk about wanting change, but truly don't. They allow themselves to be victims of people and situations and give their power away daily.
We are powerful beings if we choose to be. We can use our power to make this world a wonderful place. It is all within our reach. With the proper knowledge you can take a big step toward making this all happen by being happy and involved in healthy relationships.
Let us begin:



Relationships are typically divided up into two categories.
1) Business
2) Personal

What Are Healthy Relationships?
Every day we see a wide variety of relationships. We see our own, as well as others. And if we watch closely, we will notice how each of them operates.

Some relationships ""work"" because the parties love to fight. Others work because the parties are constantly in a game of trying to ""one up"" the other. For example: One party says I did ""A"" and the other party has to be sure and say something that will surpass that achievement.

Other people seem to lose their identity in a relationship and simply exist in it as a means to serve the other party without any of their wants or needs met; and the list of relationships that ""work"" go on and on.

Autonomy
Healthy relationships are where each party maintains autonomy. Neither party depends on each other to make them happy or whole. Within themselves they realize they are complete without any outside help. If you have autonomy, you are not depending on the other person to complete you.

One of the romantic sayings is that a person has found his/her mate who ""completes them and makes them happy."" You may feel that the other person completes you, but they will never make you happy or cause you to choosehow to feel. It has nothing to do with the other person. So, if you are looking for Mr. or Ms. Right to ""make you happy"" you are in for a big surprise -- and disappointment. The other party can certainly enrich your existence, but giving them the burden of making you happy, or fulfilling you, is going to result in a problem.
It Is You
Michael Ryce, a spiritual teacher and author, notes in his book, ""Why Is This Happening To Me ... AGAIN?!"" that what we need to realize is that we can move to Anchorage or the middle of the rain forest, and we will still have ourselves and our feelings. Every time we have an experience with another person that is disappointing to us, we need to realize that the common denominator in the situation is us. By doing this you take the focus off of the other person, and look to yourself to see what it is within you that is lacking and causing you to continue to have these experiences. Where ever you go, you are there and the problem will continue with you until you address it within yourself. Interested in learning more? Why not take an online Healthy Relationships course?
There are many people who cannot live unless they have a man or woman in their lives. It makes no difference who it is, as long as it is someone else. Often times, this someone ends up being a series of someones. This would stop if they would look within themselves and heal personal problems. However, most people will continue searchingoutside themselves for happiness and never find it. What they do find are repeat performances of the same problems they have had in the past -- only with a new person.
Working on You
The biggest problem in working to improve relationships is getting people to look within themselves. Our society is outwardly focused, meaning that it is more important who is playing in the Super Bowl than understanding why we have the issues we do.

Typically people will go to all sorts of extremes to avoid any type of introspection. They find this frightening and will fight like cats to avoid it. These folks are the ones you see with a series of broken relationships littering their lives, frequently accompanied by drug and alcohol use. They self-medicate to avoid looking within. Others stay constantly busy to keep their mind occupied. After all, if their mind is active on something else, it can't be focused on them.
When someone has autonomy, they are whole and complete within themselves. This means they are not out searching for something or someone to complete them, or fulfill them. This does not mean they do not want or have relationships. Quite the contrary. These folks have relationships but they come into them looking for nothing from the other person. For example, Mary meets John. Mary suffers from low self esteem and self worth. John is very good at building Mary up. The relationship works as long as John continues to behave and say what Mary wants. When the day comes that he does not, Mary will take it that she is not good enough, or some other interpretation to meet her belief about herself. This puts a burden many times not realized on John. Without saying it, Mary is expecting John to make her okay. When he fails to meet Mary's expectation by his words or actions on a particular day, and doesn't say what Mary wants to hear, or is used to hearing, there will be a problem.
If you are autonomous you are okay with yourself. You are not looking to come into a relationship to put the burden on someone else to make you feel valued or feel good about yourself. You are coming into the relationship simply for that -- to have a relationship with another person. You are not asking the other person to play a role that will make you complete. Can you imagine what a burden that is to the other person? I am choosing to have a relationship with you because you and your words or actions fulfill something that is lacking in me. I am only happy with you while you continue to meet this need. You may not have a clue that is what is ""making our relationship work,"" but it is.

Maintaining Your Own Power

Another thing you see in healthy relationships is what is called not giving your power away. What this means, and this goes hand in hand with the idea of autonomy, is that you do not allow others to affect you in a negative way. Let's say that you have a fellow employee you work with who talks incessantly. Never ending chatter. This behavior drives you crazy. Left to your own devices, you would be glad to explode at the offensive person and tell them to shut up. By doing this, you would be engaging in negative behavior. In this situation, you should realize thatno one can make you feel any way at all unless you choose to feel that way. What this means is, Chatty Cathy can only bother you if you give your energy to her and feed into the feeling that she is bothering you. The autonomous choice would be either to ignore her and realize that is just who and what she is, or do something constructive and see if you could be moved to another area.

What you do not want to do is allow this irritation to trigger you into exploding. When you do, you have given your power away to another person and allowed them to upset you. Keep in mind, no matter what Chatty Cathy says or does, she cannot upset you unless you choose to allow it to happen.
Giving your power away simply means you are not allowing people, places, things, or events to dictate how you feel. If a negative thought comes up, you simply choose another thought that feels better to focus on. If you want to be upset and engage in a battle with Chatty Cathy, you can, but you need to realize that you are doing so by your own choice. No one can force you to feel and react -- only you.
Wayne Dyer in his new book, ""Wishes Fulfilled,"" talks about the power we have to choose. If we get up in the morning and we feel down and negative, we can choose to accept our outlook, or we can choose another thought. We have thousands of thoughts and what we choose to focus upon dictates our feelings. People seem to want to say that ""other people"" are responsible for how they feel. They aren't. You are. Each situation in life involves a choice, and how you feel about it. You and you alone make the choice.
Being autonomous in a relationship means you come to it as a complete human being not depending on someone else to ""fix"" you. You (as well as the other person) are responsible for yourselves and your happiness. When two people come together, their relationship flows.

When they don't, the relationship will be weakened the day one of the parties doesn't get a need met, and the other party has no clue what happened. Love your partner or person you are in a relationship with, but work on yourself. That is where success lies.
Tools and Skills to Maintain Healthy Relationships
Relationships can be hard enough as it is. After all, you have two or more people who come together to interact and each has a series of unique life experiences and expectations based upon their upbringing, education, or culture. Each of us has different perspectives, wants and needs, and no two people are alike.

Too often we operate on the assumption that ""the rest of the world is like me and sees things the way I do."" Wrong.

The world is a melting pot of differing perspectives, opinions, and beliefs.
When dealing with other people one of the key things to do is: Listen. How rare this is. Next time you are around a group of people, listen to them and watch them interact. Most of the time they are either talkingover each other, not listening to the other person because they are too busy formulating what they want to say back, or are simply off in the ethers thinking about dinner. There are very few people who actually listen to what the other person is saying.

The Art of Listening is just that. Really tune in to what the person is saying. We all want to be heard and feel that what we are saying matters. If you listen and are unclear about something, politely say, ""I 'm sorry, I want be sure I understood,"" or simply repeat, ""I am understanding you to say...."" You are better off being clear, than having a miscommunication.
When talking with people and listening, you need to remember that each person has an opinion and, whether we like it or not, they are entitled to have it. We can't get invested or hung up on the fact that their opinion may differ from ours. Simply show respect by listening and consider another person's perspective. Who knows? We may learn something.
If issues arise, the best thing to do is set a time to talk.
Don't just haphazardly say, ""Here are two minutes -- tell me what your problem is."" Instead, actually tell the person you have something that you would like to set a time to talk with them about. Be respectful, and take in their views seriously.

When you talk to the person, listen and detach. Do not take what they say or do personally . Like it says in ""The Four Agreements,"" by Don Miguel Ruiz, don't take it personally. You can't. You must keep in mind while talking about the issue that what the other person is saying has nothing to do with you, but is how they see the situation.Too many people want to take what is said as a personal attack, when in reality it has nothing to do with you, but it is how the other person is interpreting the situation.
When speaking about an issue, choose language such as, ""I am feeling"" not, ""You make me feel..."" Remember, others cannot make you feel anything. Only you can choose to feel a certain way. By using this language, simply saying how you are currently feeling, and not attacking the other person, you neutralize the impact of your words. ""I am feeling""versus ""you are making me feel"" carry different connotations.
When people get together in personal relationships, it is usually because they want to be together. They enjoy their time interacting. A key to maintaining this type of relationship, especially in deciding a conflict, is to ask yourself: ""Do I want to be right, or do I want to be close."" If you want to be close to the person and maintain the relationship, then you will choose not to pursue the conflict, since being right is not as important as being close. If you decide to battle onward then you know what you really value and that should tell you about the relationship whether it should continue. If the battle is more important that opens a whole different can or worms and gives insight as to the type of relationship and whether it is healthy or not. If fighting is the priority, that speaks volumes and professional counseling may need to be obtained, either individually, or as a couple, to determine the issues underlying the battle.
No matter what the relationship is, it is always important that one person does not isolate another from friends and family. This is usually a sign of a controlling relationship, and one that can be dangerous to the well-being of a party involved. Healthy relationships realize that there are other people in our lives with whom we need to maintain contact and enjoy. Each person needs to be able to continue to enjoy those relationships, even if the other partner doesn't like the people. In healthy relationships, it is recognized that there will be people and activities that both parties do not enjoy, but they allow the other party to partake of them. Not everything needs to be done as a couple. There are different interests each person may have that the other partner doesn't. Time apart, as long as it is not consuming the relationship and making it secondary, is healthy. Not everyone is interested in the same people or activities.
Healthy relationships can be one of life's greatest joys. Using the proper tools and skills, they can flow.

How would our lives be different without social media? When our phones are often the first and last thing we see every day, it's common to wonder how social media affects every part of our lives, including our relationships. While social media has its benefits—staying in touch with those we love, getting fresh wedding inspiration, networking, or meeting new friends—our lives online can affect our realities offline. It can even become concerning when one partner's time on the internet starts to change the dynamic of a relationship.



Romantic bonds can begin through social media, but they can also be damaged by it. Whether it's a ""like"" on a photo or one person is talking to other people, it's easy to become jealous of our partner's experiences online. But what happens when the problem isn't caused by who we talk to, but the fact that we're using social media at all? If you've ever felt like you're competing with your partner's phone for their attention, you're not alone. The time we dedicate to our screens can change how we approach our partners in real life. We asked expert and author Leslie Shore to explain how to know when the internet is becoming a problem.




Meet the Expert

Leslie Shore is an interpersonal communications expert with over 20 years of experience. She is the founder of Listen to Succeed as well as a speaker, author, and professor on listening and communication.


Below, read on to learn how social media affects relationships.


   Consider the Time You Spend Online  

Shore explains that the time we spend on social media can affect our ability to communicate with those we care about. ""Research shows that, on average, we spend two or more hours a day on social media,"" Shore says. She warns that fostering relationships online can hurt our relationships offline. ""Those who have limited experience in reading people do not have the same level of social intelligence [that] previous generations possess. If this becomes the new normal, building strong, deep relationships will take more time and will be more difficult to maintain.""



When we're constantly tied to our phones scrolling through Instagram, reading the news, or checking emails, we have to learn to balance this time with being offline. It's especially important to ensure we don't neglect our loved ones in favor of screen time.



""The holds our devices have on us is invisible until someone actively calls [it] to our attention,"" says Shore, noting that we often pay more mind to our phones than those we're spending time with. ""It is almost impossible to create or enhance relationships when social media is, in the first place, taking our time and attention away from who is in front of us.""



So how do we keep our relationships strong in the age of the internet? Shore has some advice on how to keep social media from becoming a barrier.


   Be Extra Careful in Early Relationship Stages  

While the overuse of social media at any stage of a relationship can have negative effects, Shore explains that it's worse in the early stages.



""At the beginning of a relationship, we attend to the other person because we want to get to know them,"" she says. ""We listen to their likes and dislikes, history, family dynamics, dreams, and fears. We spend hours in conversation discovering each other; no fact too small, no story too long. The building of the relationship has newness and surprises. During this time, it is critical that cellphones are out of sight while in conversation to ensure total concentration on [each] other.""



Shore also warns about the dangers of messages getting misconstrued via text, especially when you're still getting to know each other: ""Texting between each other should be positive and factual,"" she says. ""Do not allow jokes or sarcasm to creep in, as they don’t translate well and create a rift instantaneously.""



If you're feeling a disconnect when you talk to your partner online or through texts, it might be best to focus on interacting in person (or try phone calls when you can't get together).



How to Announce Your Engagement on Social Media


   Think Twice Before Commenting and Posting  

While bonding over internet jokes or posts can strengthen your connection, your partner's social media content might also become a concern. Have they posted something you disagree with, or do they share a different side of their personality online? Before confronting them, think about how the conversation would go in person—it might be best to wait until you see them again to bring up anything you're uncomfortable with. Shore advocates for the need to be mindful of our partners when interacting on social media.



""Don't respond to a post or comment out of emotion,"" she says. ""Take time to process what you have read or seen, and allow yourself time to reflect on your thoughts before commenting out of anger or frustration. Remember that everyone is entitled to their own opinions.""



In the same vein, while you may be tempted to share all aspects of your life on Instagram or Facebook, remember that your partner may not feel the same way. If it's something you wouldn't overshare with your neighbors, colleagues, and extended acquaintances in real life, it probably shouldn't be on social media either. ""Keep your personal conversations personal,"" Shore says. ""There is no need to take your private life public. Posting about your partner’s choice of a birthday present for you or gossiping about your S.O. are communications best left out of the public eye.""




Don't respond to a post or comment out of emotion. Remember that everyone is entitled to their own opinions.

   Always Keep Your Loved Ones First in Mind  

While there are always risks involved when navigating social media and relationships, there are also ways to ensure that your communication stays strong. Shore explains that focusing on your real lives together—rather than interacting mostly online—is important to create a solid foundation to build your relationship on.



""Stay truly connected to those who matter,"" she says. ""Don't wish your family a happy birthday on Facebook—pick up the phone or make the trip to see them. Instead of sending invites, thank you cards, and holiday cards online, send your loved ones something they can keep forever.""



As your social media network grows, Shore also recommends being mindful of other people's beliefs and values. ""Remember who your friends are,"" she says. ""Before sharing your thoughts on politics or religion or posting something provocative or controversial, keep in mind who your audience is. Is it worth creating tension with your family, friends, or co-workers?""



However you approach your life on the internet, be mindful to think about your relationships in person before online. That's not to say you need to put your phone down entirely, so there's no need to delete your favorite apps. Social media can be exciting, fun, and a great way to relax (or keep up with friends from afar).



Find your healthy balance between both sides of the screen. When having fun online blends seamlessly with your relationships in real life, you'll discover that great new experiences can come from enjoying them both together.



Can Social Media Ruin Relationships?

2	https://www.gottman.com/about/research/couples/	Home » Our Mission » Research » Marriage and Couples
2	https://www.gottman.com/about/research/couples/	The infographic below highlights some of Dr. John Gottman’s most notable research findings on marriage and couple relationships. For a more in-depth review of the three phases of Gottman’s research with marriage and couples, continue reading.
2	https://www.gottman.com/about/research/couples/	In 1976, Dr. Robert Levenson and Dr. John Gottman teamed up to combine the study of emotion with psycho-physiological measurement and a video-recall method that gave us rating dial measures (still applying game theory) of how people felt during conflict. This was the new way of getting the “talk table” numbers. The research also became longitudinal. They made no predictions in the first study, but they were interested in a measure of “physiological linkage,” because a prior study showed that the skin conductance of two nurses was correlated only if they disliked one another. They thought that might be linked to negative affect in couples. Indeed it was.
2	https://www.gottman.com/about/research/couples/	They were also amazed that in their first study with 30 couples they were able to “predict” the change in marital satisfaction almost perfectly with their physiological measures. The results revealed that the more physiologically aroused couples were (in all channels, including heart rate, skin conductance, gross motor activity, and blood velocity), the more their marriages deteriorated in happiness over a three-year period, even controlling the initial level of marital satisfaction.
2	https://www.gottman.com/about/research/couples/	The rating dial and their observational coding of the interaction also “predicted” changes in relationship satisfaction. Such large correlations in the data were unprecedented. Furthermore, Gottman and Levenson had preceded the conflict conversation with a reunion conversation (in which couples talked about the events of their day before the conflict discussion), and they had followed the conflict discussion with a positive topic. Gottman and Levenson were amazed to discover that harsh startup by women in the conflict discussion was predictable by the male partner’s disinterest or irritability in the events of the day discussion. They found that the quality of the couple’s friendship, especially as maintained by men, was critical in understanding conflict. Furthermore, the ability to rebound from, or “repair”, conflict to the positive conversation became a marker of emotion regulation ability of couples.
2	https://www.gottman.com/about/research/couples/	Both Levenson and Gottman had discovered Dr. Paul Ekman and Dr. Wallace Friesen’s Facial Affect Coding System (FACS), and Gottman subsequently developed the Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF), which was an integration of FACS and earlier systems in the Gottman lab.
2	https://www.gottman.com/about/research/couples/	The SPAFF became the main system that Gottman used to code couples’ interaction. At first, it took 25 hours to code 15 minutes of interaction, but later Gottman was able to get the same coding done in just 45 minutes, with no loss of reliability. Gottman also began applying time-series analysis to the analysis of interaction data. He wrote, Time-Series Analysis: A Comprehensive Introduction for Social Scientists, a book on time-series analysis to explain these methods to psychologists, and developed some new methods for analyzing dominance and bi-directionality with James Ringland.
2	https://www.gottman.com/about/research/couples/	Soon after, Gottman and Levenson received their first grant together and began attempting to replicate their observations from the first study. The subsequent studies they conducted in their labs with colleagues eventually spanned the entire life course — with the longest of the studies following couples for 20 years, in Levenson’s Berkeley lab.
2	https://www.gottman.com/about/research/couples/	The Gottman lab at the University of Illinois also studied the linkages between marital interaction, parenting, and children’s social development with Dr. Lynn Katz, and later at the University of Washington involved studying these linkages with infants with Dr. Alyson Shapiro. Gottman developed the concept of “meta-emotion”, which is how people feel about emotion (such as specific emotions like anger), emotional expression, and emotional understanding in general. Meta-emotion mismatches between parents in that study predicted divorce with 80% accuracy.
2	https://www.gottman.com/about/research/couples/	Gottman and Levenson discovered that couples interaction had enormous stability over time (about 80% stability in conflict discussions separated by 3 years). They also discovered that most relationship problems (69%) never get resolved but are “perpetual problems” based on personality differences between partners.
2	https://www.gottman.com/about/research/couples/	In seven longitudinal studies, one with violent couples (with Neil Jacobson), the predictions replicated. Gottman could predict whether a couple would divorce with an average of over 90% accuracy, across studies using the ratio of positive to negative SPAFF codes, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Criticism, Defensiveness, Contempt, and Stonewalling), physiology, the rating dial, and an interview they devised, the Oral History Interview, as coded by Kim Buehlman’s coding system.
2	https://www.gottman.com/about/research/couples/	Gottman could predict whether or not their stable couples would be happy or unhappy using measures of positive affect during conflict. With Dr. Jim Coan, he discovered that positive affect was used not randomly, but to physiologically soothe the partner. Gottman also discovered that in heterosexual relationships, men accepting influence from their wives was predictive of happy and stable marriages. Bob Levenson also discovered that humor was physiologically soothing and that empathy had a physiological substrate (in research with Dr. Anna Ruef), using the rating dial.
2	https://www.gottman.com/about/research/couples/	The third phase of Gottman’s research program was devoted to trying to understand the empirical predictions, and thus building and then testing theory. Ultimately, Gottman aimed to build a theory that was testable or disconfirmable.
2	https://www.gottman.com/about/research/couples/	Testing theory in the psychological field requires clinical interventions. In 1996, the Gottman lab returned to intervention research with Dr. Julie Schwartz Gottman. John and Julie Gottman designed both proximal and distal change studies. In a proximal change study, one intervenes briefly with interventions designed only to make the second of two conflict discussions less divorce-prone. In one of these studies, they discovered that a 20-minute break, in which couples stopped talking and just read magazines (as their heart rates returned to baseline), dramatically changed the discussion, so that people had access to their sense of humor and affection.
2	https://www.gottman.com/about/research/couples/	Together with Julie, John Gottman started building the Sound Relationship House Theory. That theory became the basis of the design of clinical interventions for couples in John Gottman’s book, The Marriage Clinic, and Julie Gottman’s book, The Marriage Clinic Casebook. In August of 1996, they founded The Gottman Institute to continue to develop evidence-based approaches to improving couples therapy outcomes.
