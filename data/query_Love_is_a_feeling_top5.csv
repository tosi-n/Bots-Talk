time and attention away from who is in front of us    so how do we keep our relationships strong in the age of the internet shore has some advice on how to keep social media from becoming a barrier      be extra careful in early relationship stages    while the overuse of social media at any stage of a relationship can have negative effects shore explains that its worse in the early stages    at the beginning of a relationship we attend to the other person because we want to get to know them she says we listen to their likes and dislikes history family dynamics dreams and fears we spend hours in conversation discovering each other no fact too small no story too long the building of the relationship has newness and surprises during this time it is critical that cellphones are out of sight while in conversation to ensure total concentration on each other    shore also warns about the dangers of messages getting misconstrued via text especially when youre still getting to know each other texting between each other should be positive and factual she says do not allow jokes or sarcasm to creep in as they don’t translate well and create a rift instantaneously    if youre feeling a

have they posted something you disagree with or do they share a different side of their personality online before confronting them think about how the conversation would go in person—it might be best to wait until you see them again to bring up anything youre uncomfortable with shore advocates for the need to be mindful of our partners when interacting on social media    dont respond to a post or comment out of emotion she says take time to process what you have read or seen and allow yourself time to reflect on your thoughts before commenting out of anger or frustration remember that everyone

something you wouldnt overshare with your neighbors colleagues and extended acquaintances in real life it probably shouldnt be on social media either keep your personal conversations personal shore says there is no need to take your private life public posting about your partner’s choice of a birthday present for you or gossiping about your so are communications best left out of the public eye     dont respond to a post or comment out of emotion remember that everyone is entitled to their own opinions     always keep your loved ones first in mind    while there are always risks involved when

online—is important to create a solid foundation to build your relationship on    stay truly connected to those who matter she says dont wish your family a happy birthday on facebook—pick up the phone

recommends being mindful of other peoples beliefs and values remember who your friends are she says before sharing your thoughts on politics or religion or posting something provocative or controversial keep in mind who your audience is is it worth creating tension with your family friends or coworkers    however you approach your life on the internet be mindful to think about your

catalog                       		the dynamics of healthy relationships 	           healthy relationship dynamics    since the dawn of time people have been trying to get along such a simple task has proven over the centuries to be a daunting one in certain situations getting along has been completely impossible for some reason despite the fact that we are all human with the same five senses and bodily functions we are all completely different  so different that we have been told over the years that no two people even have the same fingerprint thats pretty amazing when you realize that at last count there were around 64 billion people in the world whether it is a relationship with our family our spouse our children or employees it seems that getting along and maintaining healthy relationships has become the eighth wonder of the world to compound matters as humans we can also have relationships with things such as our bank account our jobs and our possessions  we have relationships and the potential for relationships all around us  some of which you may not have realized you had they are all there and either taking positive time and space or negative time and space in your life  which depends on how you choose to distribute your power you may have noticed the word choose is used regarding how we handle our relationships this article is based on the concept that all relationships we are involved in and our response to them are a matter of choice we are not victims  unless we choose to be life and our reaction to it depends on many things but the bottom line is we choose how to interpret and handle our relationships you will examine your belief systems and those of the people around you and learn how they are affecting your life in addition we will look at a wide variety of skills that can be developed to empower you and make your relationships a meaningful and positive part of your life at times you will be asked to consider new and different ideas that will force you to think outside of your comfort zone are you ready to do that are you willing  there is a saying to get to the fruit of the tree you have to go out on the green leafy branches many people fear this and are comfortable in their enclosed world it may not be working for them but their unhappiness is a known comfort they would rather stay in their unhappiness than think outside the box they like to talk about wanting change but truly dont they allow themselves to be victims of people and situations and give their power away daily we are powerful beings if we choose to be we can use our power to make this world a wonderful place it is all within our reach with the proper knowledge you can take a big step toward making this all happen by being happy and involved in healthy relationships let us begin    relationships are typically divided up into two categories 1 business 2 personal  what are healthy relationships every day we see a wide variety of relationships we see our own as well as others and if we watch closely we will notice how each of them operates  some relationships work because the parties love to fight others work because the parties are constantly in a game of trying to one up the other for example one party says i did a and the other party has to be sure and say something that will surpass that achievement  other people seem to lose their identity in a relationship and simply exist in it as a means to serve the other party without any of their wants or needs met and the list of relationships that work go on and on  autonomy healthy relationships are where each party maintains autonomy neither party depends on each other to make them happy or whole within themselves they realize they are complete without any outside help if you have autonomy you are not depending on the other person to complete you  one of the romantic sayings is that a person has found hisher mate who completes them and makes them happy you may feel that the other person completes you but they will never make you happy or cause you to choosehow to feel it has nothing to do with the other person so if you are looking for mr or ms right to make you happy you are in for a big surprise  and disappointment the other party can certainly enrich your existence but giving them the burden of making you happy or fulfilling you is going to result in a problem it is you michael ryce a spiritual teacher and author notes in his book why is this happening to me  again that what we need to realize is that we can move to anchorage or the middle of the rain forest and we will still have ourselves and our feelings every time we have an experience with another person that is disappointing to us we need to realize that the common denominator in the situation is us by doing this you take the focus off of the other person and look to yourself to see what it is within you that is lacking and causing you to continue to have these experiences where ever you go you are there and the problem will continue with you until you address it within yourself interested in learning more why not take an online healthy relationships course there are many people who cannot live unless they have a man or woman in their lives it makes no difference who it is as long as it is someone else often times this someone ends up being a series of someones this would stop if they would look within themselves and heal personal problems however most people will continue searchingoutside themselves for happiness and never find it what they do find are repeat performances of the same problems they have had in the past  only with a new person working on you the biggest problem in working to improve relationships is getting people to look within themselves our society is outwardly focused meaning that it is more important who is playing in the super bowl than understanding why we have the issues we do  typically people will go to all sorts of extremes to avoid any type of introspection they find this frightening and will fight like cats to avoid it these folks are the ones you see with a series of broken relationships littering their lives frequently accompanied by drug and alcohol use they selfmedicate to avoid looking within others stay constantly busy to keep their mind occupied after all if their mind is active on something else it cant be focused on them when someone has autonomy they are whole and complete within themselves this means they are not out searching for something or someone to complete them or fulfill them this does not mean they do not want or have relationships quite the contrary these folks have relationships but they come into them looking for nothing from the other person for example mary meets john mary suffers from low self esteem and self worth john is very good at building mary up the relationship works as long as john continues to behave and say what mary wants when the day comes that he does not mary will take it that she is not good enough or some other interpretation to meet her belief about herself this puts a burden many times not realized on john without saying it mary is expecting john to make her okay when he fails to meet marys expectation by his words or actions on a particular day and doesnt say what mary wants to hear or is used to hearing there will be a problem if you are autonomous you are okay with yourself you are not looking to come into a relationship to put the burden on someone else to make you feel valued or feel good about yourself you are coming into the relationship simply for that  to have a relationship with another person you are not asking the other person to play a role that will make you complete can you imagine what a burden that is to the other person i am choosing to have a relationship with you because you and your words or actions fulfill something that is lacking in me i am only happy with you while you continue to meet this need you may not have a clue that is what is making our relationship work but it is  maintaining your own power  another thing you see in healthy relationships is what is called not giving your power away what this means and this goes hand in hand with the idea of autonomy is that you do not allow others to affect you in a negative way lets say that you have a fellow employee you work with who talks incessantly never ending chatter this behavior drives you crazy left to your own devices you would be glad to explode at the offensive person and tell them to shut up by doing this you would be engaging in negative behavior in this situation you should realize thatno one can make you feel any way at all unless you choose to feel that way what this means is chatty cathy can only bother you if you give your energy to her and feed into the feeling that she is bothering you the autonomous choice would be either to ignore her and realize that is just who and what she is or do something constructive and see if you could be moved to another area  what you do not want to do is allow this irritation to trigger you into exploding when you do you have given your power away to another person and allowed them to upset you keep in mind no matter what chatty cathy says or does she cannot upset you unless you choose to allow it to happen giving your power away simply means you are not allowing people places things or events to dictate how you feel if a negative thought comes up you simply choose another thought that feels better to focus on if you want to be upset and engage in a battle with chatty cathy you can but you need to realize that you are doing so by your own choice no one can force you to feel and react  only you wayne dyer in his new book wishes fulfilled talks about the power we have to choose if we get up in the morning and we feel down and negative we can choose to accept our outlook or we can choose another thought we have thousands of thoughts and what we choose to focus upon dictates our feelings people seem to want to say that other people are responsible for how they feel they arent you are each situation in life involves a choice and how you feel about it you and you alone make the choice being autonomous in a relationship means you come to it as a complete human being not depending on someone else to fix you you as well as the other person are responsible for yourselves and your happiness when two people come together their relationship flows  when they dont the relationship will be weakened the day one of the parties doesnt get a need met and the other party has no clue what happened love your partner or person you are in a relationship with but work on yourself that is where success lies tools and skills to maintain healthy relationships relationships can be hard enough as it is after all you have two or more people who come together to interact and each has a series of unique life experiences and expectations based upon their upbringing education or culture each of us has different perspectives wants and needs and no two people are alike  too often we operate on the assumption that the rest of the world is like me and sees things the way i do wrong  the world is a melting pot of differing perspectives opinions and beliefs when dealing with other people one of the key things to do is listen how rare this is next time you are around a group of people listen to them and watch them interact most of the time they are either talkingover each other not listening to the other person because they are too busy formulating what they want to say back or are simply off in the ethers thinking about dinner there are very few people who actually listen to what the other person is saying  the art of listening is just that really tune in to what the person is saying we all want to be heard and feel that what we are saying matters if you listen and are unclear about something politely say i m sorry i want be sure i understood or simply repeat i am understanding you to say you are better off being clear than having a miscommunication when talking with people and listening you need to remember that each person has an opinion and whether we like it or not they are entitled to have it we cant get invested or hung up on the fact that their opinion may differ from ours simply show respect by listening and consider another persons perspective who knows we may learn something if issues arise the best thing to do is set a time to talk dont just haphazardly say here are two minutes  tell me what your problem is instead actually tell the person you have something that you would like to set a time to talk with them about be respectful and take in their views seriously  when you talk to the person listen and detach do not take what they say or do personally  like it says in the four agreements by don miguel ruiz dont take it personally you cant you must keep in mind while talking about the issue that what the other person is saying has nothing to do with you but is how they see the situationtoo many people want to take what is said as a personal attack when in reality it has nothing to do with you but it is how the other person is interpreting the situation when speaking about an issue choose language such as i am feeling not you make me feel remember others cannot make you feel anything only you can choose to feel a certain way by using this language simply saying how you are currently feeling and not attacking the other person you neutralize the impact of your words i am feelingversus you are making me feel carry different connotations when people get together in personal relationships it is usually because they want to be together they enjoy their time interacting a key to maintaining this type of relationship especially in deciding a conflict is to ask yourself do i want to be right or do i want to be close if you want to be close to the person and maintain the relationship then you will choose not to pursue the conflict since being right is not as important as being close if you decide to battle onward then you know what you really value and that should tell you about the relationship whether it should continue if the battle is more important that opens a whole different can or worms and gives insight as to the type of relationship and whether it is healthy or not if fighting is the priority that speaks volumes and professional counseling may need to be obtained either individually or as a couple to determine the issues underlying the battle no matter what the relationship is it is always important that one person does not isolate another from friends and family this is usually a sign of a controlling relationship and one that can be dangerous to the wellbeing of a party involved healthy relationships realize that there are other people in our lives with whom we need to maintain contact and enjoy each person needs to be able to continue to enjoy those relationships even if the other partner doesnt like the people in healthy relationships it is recognized that there will be people and activities that both parties do not enjoy but they allow the other party to partake of them not everything needs to be done as a couple there are different interests each person may have that the other partner doesnt time apart as long as it is not consuming the relationship and making it secondary is healthy not everyone is interested in the same people or activities healthy relationships can be one of lifes greatest joys using the

2,https://www.gottman.com/about/research/couples/,in 1976 dr robert levenson and dr john gottman teamed up to combine the study of emotion with psychophysiological measurement and a videorecall method that gave us rating dial measures still applying game theory of how people felt during conflict this was the new way of getting the “talk table” numbers the research also became longitudinal they made no predictions in the first study but they were interested in a measure of “physiological linkage” because a prior study showed that the skin conductance of two nurses was correlated only if they disliked one another they thought that might be linked to negative affect in couples indeed it was,0.0
2,https://www.gottman.com/about/research/couples/,they were also amazed that in their first study with 30 couples they were able to “predict” the change in marital satisfaction almost perfectly with their physiological measures the results revealed that the more physiologically aroused couples were in all channels including heart rate skin conductance gross motor activity and blood velocity the more their marriages deteriorated in happiness over a threeyear period even controlling the initial level of marital satisfaction,0.0
2,https://www.gottman.com/about/research/couples/,the rating dial and their observational coding of the interaction also “predicted” changes in relationship satisfaction such large correlations in the data were unprecedented furthermore gottman and levenson had preceded the conflict conversation with a reunion conversation in which couples talked about the events of their day before the conflict discussion and they had followed the conflict discussion with a positive topic gottman and levenson were amazed to discover that harsh startup by women in the conflict discussion was predictable by the male partner’s disinterest or irritability in the events of the day discussion they found that the quality of the couple’s friendship especially as maintained by men was critical in understanding conflict furthermore the ability to rebound from or “repair” conflict to the positive conversation became a marker of emotion regulation ability of couples,0.0
